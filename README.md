# VintageRoom

### 1.	The idea of my Project
I made a website for a small beautiful vintage clothing shop in my home country, Moldova. This is a Selected vintage made in France called Vintage Room, you can find them on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/vintageroom.md/. We don’t have many vintage clothing shops in Moldova and this is one of the places where you can find fascinating clothes. The store owners treat it with great love and carefully choose every item. Also, you fill differently in this store and mass market.

### 4.	Technological stack
I decided to use MERN stack in my web-site
The MERN stack is a popular combination of technologies used to develop web applications. It consists of four main technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Each technology plays a specific role in the stack:

•	MongoDB: It is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is a flexible and scalable database that allows developers to store and retrieve data easily.

•	Express.js: It is a backend web application framework that runs on top of Node.js. Express.js provides a set of tools and features to create web applications, such as routing, middleware, and templates.

•	React: It is a frontend JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. React allows developers to build reusable UI components and provides a fast, efficient way to render them.

•	Node.js: It is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a set of tools and features to create server-side applications, such as APIs, web servers, and real-time applications.

The MERN stack allows developers to build scalable, high-performance web applications with a consistent codebase. It is a popular choice for startups and enterprises alike due to its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Additionally, MERN stack developers can leverage the large number of open-source packages available in the Node.js ecosystem, making development faster and more efficient.
I also used Passport.js. Is an authentication middleware for Node.js that simplifies the process of implementing authentication in web applications. It provides an easy-to-use framework for handling user authentication, authorization, and session management.

### 5.	Instructions, on how to install my developed project to the server
You need to split the terminal and install all dependencies by running npm install in both cd server and cd client. Then you can run npm run dev in cd server and npm start in cd client.
